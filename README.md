# My .dotfiles
A new year, something new to explore!

I have been using Linux for the past couple of years. From installing my first Linux Distro to troubleshooting problems — everything was an 
enjoyable and thrilling experience. Until last year, I never used a tiling window manager. I frequently hopped from one distro to another 
but never tried out a tiling window manager on a physical machine.

So, it's time to try something new — start using a tiling window manager! I have decided to start my tiling window manager journey by using i3. 
Hoping that it's gonna be fun!

Feel free to use my .dotfiles. I will try to write the dotfiles on my own. If I copy snippets from someone or become inspired by someone, I will try my 
best to mention the author here in this README file, or at least mention that in the config's comment.

Also, feel free to correct my mistakes by [creating an issue](https://github.com/fahmidbinfarooqui/.dotfiles/issues/new) or 
[pulling a pull request](https://github.com/fahmidbinfarooqui/.dotfiles/pulls) or simply emailing me at fahmid147@gmail.com.
